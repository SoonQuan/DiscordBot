        "Null_1": "**Null** was born in the harsh environment of the winter-lands, the founder was a young king who had lost the support of his people, his time was running out. He took refuge in a cottage a few miles away from the castle staying undiscovered. The cottage was owned by a young and well-built man who was unfortunately very poor. The king offered him the minimum to survive if he would be able to take refuge in the cottage for the rest of his life, (mind you the king was young stated again, the cottage owner was about the same age). They both became very close friends due to the rough circumstances.\n\nA month or two later, a young child was left at their doorstep, being 2 men it was weird to raise a child without a mother (not being homophobic just medieval times). The two decided to have this stupid idea to raise their kingdom, even though there were several nearby which could easily conquer them.\n\nThey began gathering members slowly, peasants, farmers, usually the low-class people of other kingdoms. Soon the other kingdoms had realised they were losing farmers and workers mysteriously, so they decided to take a look into their surrounding territories. The young king was discovered and left the king role to his closest friend, the king said he'd leave and return one day once the suspicion of the nearby kingdoms died down, unfortunately, this lead to a severe drop in livelihood in the small kingdom, people couldn't afford to pay for food and died off slowly.\n\nThis was happening while the young newborn (the child who the two friends raised) was about 15 years of age, he is older now and understood some of the responsibilities. The king had left the country in his friend's hands which was a tough job and extremely hard to manage, so the child that they had raised decided to step in even being at a young age.",
        "Null_2": "*[The story will be a bit harder to explain if the characters are not named so let us call the child Samuel and the now grown man (king's closest friend) is called James]*\n\nSamuel devised plans to slowly build up citizens of the kingdom but it would require inhumane sacrifices. He decided to kill off parts of the population which allowed the others to survive and grow much stronger than if they had played it safe. James in the meantime was still overcome with the grief of his lost friend and slowed down, usually spending his time helping Samuel by securing his authority and presenting speeches thought up by Samuel.\n\nThe Kingdom was growing and for the first time, there was light at the end of the cold barren tunnel. Samuel knew that he had to keep going until the rightful king returned. The Kingdom eventually grew large enough such that its authority was high enough to make treaties and alliances with others.\n\nAnd the first alliance was born, a small kingdom in the less harsh environments in Springdale, it was wealthy but had no desire to grow at the time, it wanted to take it slow.\n\n*[Let us call Samuel's Kingdom Nefarati and let us call the new friendly kingdom Garodier]*\n\nThe two alliance were highly benefiting from each other. One gained the numbers needed for a functioning kingdom while the other had a new alliance that would increase their military authority. This continued until even Garodier was reaching its capacity and had grown wealthy enough to partly function on its own. Then it was time to find a new kingdom that would be willing to take on the treaty offers.\n\nAnother kingdom named Kardali in the Springlands territory had been willing to take the offer, surprisingly they were already a well-established kingdom with slow movements on the military map but were stable and prone to attacks from neighbouring kingdoms. The three new kingdoms would then continue to grow for a long time.",
        "Null_3": "The previous king of Nefarati was found lying on the side of a riverbank shortly after the new alliance, the finders of the body said that it was only a pile of bones but technology had advanced and they could tell the righteous king had passed away long before. The hope for the return of the king was destroyed. \n\nGrief struck.\n\nStill, the three stable kingdoms functioned properly so the grief meant nothing to the well-being of the kingdoms.\nJames was getting old, he spent less and less time governing and more time focusing on his authority and to hold it. Samuel was pulling all the strings at this point he was like the shogun and James was the emperor. Samuel had all the power but used it under the emperor's name.\n\nSamuel also eventually grew old but that didn't stop him from continuing to find alliances, soon enough he had taken another 2 guilds under the alliance's wing.\n\nTo be continued...\n\nNefarati - Null\nGarodier - Gods Amongst You\nKardali - Kunai\nOld King - Zymus\nKing best friend (James) - Jin\nSamuel - Sunset",
